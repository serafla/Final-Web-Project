            The Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival has been a part of Philadelphia since 1997. Initially, the festival
            focused on the tree planting efforts of the Japan America Society of Greater Philadelphia. Echoing a
            sesquicentennial gift of 1,600 flowering trees made by Japan to Philadelphia in 1926, JASGP pledged to plant
            1,000 cherry trees in Fairmount Park. This goal was accomplished in 2007, and the mission has expanded to
            plant cherry trees in community parks throughout the region.

            As the number of cherry trees increased, so did Philadelphiansâ€™ interest in Japan. The Festival expanded to
            include an array of activities, from sushi making workshops and cultural demonstrations to music and dance
            performances. Together with the Philadelphia Flower Show, the Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival has become
            synonymous with the return of spring to Greater Philadelphia.
