            A project of the Japan America Society of Greater Philadelphia, the Subaru Cherry Blossom Festival is an
            annual celebration not only of spring and beautiful blossoms, but of Japanese culture as well. The
            Cherry Blossom Festival takes its name and central inspiration from the fleeting beauty of the sakura,
            the Japanese name for cherry blossoms. Each year, over the course of nine days, the events of the
            Festival celebrate Philadelphiaâ€™s rich cultural connections with the art, music, food, natural beauty,
            and industry of Japan.
